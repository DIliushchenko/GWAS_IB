## Description
In this project, the main task is to get acquainted with the genome wide association study (GWAS) and the construction of polygenic risk scores (PRS). GWAS analysis includes several steps of quality control (QC), population stratification, as well as the conduct of the GWAS analysis itself. At the end, the calculation of the PRS based on the statistics of the GWAS will be analyzed. All steps of QC were taken from [Marees et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/)

## Data
The data is precented by 39041 people from the Russian cohort, gentified using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array (GSA) provided by Genotek. Since the Genotek data cannot be provided to third parties, we recommend using [simulated data]() for all steps.
